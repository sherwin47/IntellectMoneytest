How to Resolve Them
To make these letters disappear, you need to stage and commit your changes. This tells Git to save a new version of your project.

1. Stage Your Changes
Run the following command in your terminal. This tells Git to get ready to save all the modified (M) and new (U) files.

PowerShell

git add .
After you run this, the letters might change to 'A' (for Added) or 'M' depending on your setup.

2. Commit Your Changes
Now, save your staged changes with a descriptive message.

PowerShell

git commit -m "Add JWT authentication and save financial plans"
After the commit is complete, the 'M' and 'U' letters will disappear because you have successfully saved the current state of your project.
